I tried recreating a minigame that I frequently played while I was young. 
It was the Bomb Factory minigame in BomberMan Land Touch for the DS. 
The gameplay is the same as the Train of Thought minigame found in Luminosity. 
Took 2-3 days to code. 

Rules/Controls:
Use the mouse to click on the arrows to direct the bombs into the conveyor whose colour matches the bomb's.
Any bomb with a spark must be dumped into the black rectangle, and any bomb without cannot be dumped into the black rectangle.
The conveyor belt will speed up until one bomb has been moved to an incorrect location.
